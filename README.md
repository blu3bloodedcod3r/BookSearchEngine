## Description

Took starter code and adapted from RESTFUL API to Apollo servers

- My motivation was to learn how to adapt old API's to more performant usage from the Apollo server
- I completed this project so that I could learn more about adaptation to Apollo server
- This solves the issue of API being depreacted to using a more profficent way of loading things with the Apollo server
- I learned how to manipulate from restful API's to the Apollo server
